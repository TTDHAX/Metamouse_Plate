Materials:
* any mouse chipboard
* solid wires
* aluminum foil
* gloves (optional)
* paper finger hats
* double sided tape
* masking tape

Instructions:

Mouse Setup
1. Remove the cover of the mouse and take the chip (I assume that you already did that).
2. Remove/Desolder the left click button and right click button.
3. Solder the wire on the first/ topmost hole in the space where you removed the button (There should be three each button) (Look at the diagram).
4. Solder another wire on the second hole / below the first hole / beside the first hole.
5. Do to the other button's vacant space

Metal plate
1. Get some cardboard / illustration board / piece of wood and cover it with double sided tape
2. Put the wire first, i keep forgetting to put the wire first XD (Strip the wire obviously)
3. Then place the aluminum foil on the cardboard and apply force/pressure to assure that it sticks
4. Thats it

Glove / Finger Hat Setup:
1. I will post a series of pictures on how to make these
2. Use double sided tape and put it on the finger hat / glove finger tips.
3. Place the wires on the index finger and middle finger tips with the tape and let it stick
4. Then put the aluminum foil on the fingertip and cover the area with the tape, you can cut the excess


Combining Setup
1. Get the wire from the first holes of the left and right button and connect / solder it to the wire at the metal plate
2. The second hole's wire on the left button will be the left click, which you should connect/solder to the wire of the middle finger fingerhat
3. Connect / solder the wire of the second hole of the right button to the index finger fingerhat.

Extra things you can do:
1. Give some space on the cardboard you use as the metal plate and use double sided tape to attatch it to the plate, you can
also stitch / sew it on the cardboard.
2. If you are using a glove, you can sew the mouse chipboard to the glove. (See the picture)

Ill try to make a video but for now, im currently busy because of school works.
